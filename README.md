# Who Wants To Be A Crypto Millionaire

A blockchain-inspired, crypto-themed version of the classic **Who Wants To Be A Millionaire** quiz game.

Answer increasingly difficult Web3, cryptocurrency, blockchain, DeFi, NFT and crypto-culture questions to climb the prize ladder — now measured in **BTC**!

- Prize ladder in **BTC** instead of fiat
- Lifelines with crypto flavor (Halving, Community Poll, DM a Whale...)

## How to Play (locally)

1. Clone the repo
   ```bash

## Game Rules

There are **15 questions** in total.

Each question is worth an increasing amount of **BTC**.

There is **no time limit** — take as long as you need to answer.

You get **three lifelines** to help if you're stuck:

- 50/50 (renamed "Halving" in crypto version)
- Ask the Audience (renamed "Community Poll")
- Phone a Friend (renamed "DM a Whale")

The questions are grouped into **5 levels** (3 questions per level), with difficulty increasing gradually.

Reaching question 5 and question 10 are **safe havens** — you lock in that prize amount even if you get later questions wrong.
